### Cloning?  Use a shallow clone and avoid 400 Mb of history

A **shallow clone** is a good idea because you probably don't need many years of history.

Like this:

    git clone --depth 5 https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts.git

## Extensions
The unified hosts file is extensible.  You manage extensions by curating the 
`extensions/` folder tree. See the `social`, `gambling`, and `porn` extension 
folders.

## Generate your own unified hosts file

The `updateHostsFile.py` script, which is python 2.7 and Python 3-compatible,
will generate a unified hosts file based on the sources in the local `data/`
subfolder.  The script will prompt you Whether it should fetch updated
versions (from locations defined by the `update.json` text file in each
source's folder), otherwise it will use the `hosts` file that's already there.

### Usage

#### Using Python 3:

    python3 updateHostsFile.py [--auto] [--replace] [--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn] [--extensions ext1 ext2 ext3]

#### Using Python 2.7:

    python updateHostsFile.py [--auto] [--replace] [--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn] [--extensions ext1 ext2 ext3]

#### Command line options:

`--help`, or `-h`: display help.

`--auto`, or `-a`: run the script without prompting. When `--auto` is invoked,

* Hosts data sources, including extensions, are updated.
* No extensions are included by default.  Use the `--extensions` or `-e` flag 
to include any you want.
* Your active hosts file is *not* replaced unless you include the `--replace` 
flag.

`--backup`, or `-b`: Make a backup of existing hosts file(s) as you generate 
over them.

`--extensions <ext1> <ext2> <ext3>`, or `-e <ext1> <ext2> <ext3>`: the names 
of subfolders below the `extensions` folder containing additional 
category-specific hosts files to include in the amalgamation. Example: 
`--extensions porn` or `-e social porn`.

`--flush-dns-cache`, or `-f`: skip the prompt for flushing the DNS cache.  
Only active when `--replace` is also active.

`--ip nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`, or `-i nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn`: the IP address to use as the 
target.  Default is `0.0.0.0`.

`--keepdomaincomments`, or `-k`: `false` (default) or `true`, keep the comments 
that appear on the same line as domains.  The default is `false` since some
router-based implementations can't handle comments in-line with hosts.

`--skipstatichosts`, or `-s`: `false` (default) or `true`, 

`--noupdate`, or `-n`: skip fetching updates from hosts data sources.

`--output <subfolder>`, or `-o <subfolder>`: place the generated source file 
in a subfolder.  If the subfolder does not exist, it will be created.

`--replace`, or `-r`: trigger replacing your active hosts

`--skipstatichosts`, or `-s`: `false` (default) or `true`, omit the standard
`--section, at the top containing lines like `127.0.0.1 localhost`.  This is
`--useful for configuring proximate DNS services on the local network.

`--zip`, or `-z`: `false` (default) or `true`, additionally create a zip
`--archive of the hosts file named `hosts.zip`.

## How do I control which sources are unified?

Add one or more  *additional* sources, each in a subfolder of the `data/`
folder, and specify the `url` key in its `update.json` file.

Add one or more *optional* extensions, which originate from subfolders of the
`extensions/` folder.  Again the url in `update.json` controls where this
extension finds its updates.

Create an *optional* `blacklist` file. The contents of this file (containing a
listing of additional domains in `hosts` file format) are appended to the
unified hosts file during the update process. A sample `blacklist` is
included, and may be modified as you desire.

  * NOTE: The `blacklist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't
be overridden when you `git pull`   this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I include my own custom domain mappings?

If you have custom hosts records, place them in file `myhosts`.  The contents
of this file are prepended to the unified hosts file during the update
process.

The `myhosts` file is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
overridden when you `git pull` this repo from `origin` in the future.

### How do I prevent domains from being included?

The domains you list in the `whitelist` file are excluded from the final hosts
file.

The `whitelist` uses partial matching.  Therefore if you whitelist
`google-analytics.com`, that domain and all its subdomains won't be merged
into the final hosts file.

The `whitelist` is not tracked by git, so any changes you make won't be
overridden when you `git pull` this repo  from `origin` in the future.


## What is a hosts file?

A hosts file, named `hosts` (with no file extension), is a plain-text file
used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses.

In most operating systems, the `hosts` file is preferential to `DNS`.
Therefore if a domain name is resolved by the `hosts` file, the request never
leaves your computer.

Having a smart `hosts` file goes a long way towards blocking malware, adware,
and other irritants.

For example, to nullify requests to some doubleclick.net servers, adding these
lines to your hosts file will do it:

    # block doubleClick's servers
    0.0.0.0 ad.ae.doubleclick.net
    0.0.0.0 ad.ar.doubleclick.net
    0.0.0.0 ad.at.doubleclick.net
    0.0.0.0 ad.au.doubleclick.net
    0.0.0.0 ad.be.doubleclick.net
    # etc...


## We recommend using `0.0.0.0` instead of `127.0.0.1`

Traditionally most host files use `127.0.0.1`, the *loopback address*, to establish an IP connection to the local machine.

We prefer to use ``0.0.0.0`, which is defined as a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown,
or non applicable target.

Using `0.0.0.0` is empirically faster, possibly because there's no wait for a timeout resolution. It also does not
interfere with a web server that may be running on the local PC.

## Why not use just `0` instead of `0.0.0.0`?
We tried that.  Using `0` doesn't work universally.


## Location of your hosts file
To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text
editor.

**Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Linux**: `/etc/hosts` folder.

**Windows**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` folder.

## Reloading hosts file
Your operating system will cache DNS lookups. You can either reboot or run the following commands to
manually flush your DNS cache once the new hosts file is in place.

### Mac OS X
Open a Terminal and run:
```
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
```

### Windows

|`makeHostsWindows.bat` BATCH file will create various alternate hosts files by combining and adding the gambling, porn, and social media extensions. You need to be connected to the Internet. This file REQUIRED installed Python 3.5.x runtime environment in Windows System. Launch this file as normal user.|
:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Run `updateHostsWindows.bat` BATCH file in Command Prompt with Administrator privileges in repository directory for easy update, replace hosts file and reload DNS cache in Windows System. You need to be connected to the Internet. This file REQUIRED installed Python 3.5.x runtime environment in Windows System.|
:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

|WARNING: Don't run these BAT files directly or from popup menu. You have been warned.|
:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open a Command Prompt in directory where are files from this repository:

**Windows XP**: Start -> Run -> `cmd`

**Windows Vista, 7**: Start Button -> type `cmd` -> right-click Command Prompt ->
"Run as Administrator"

**Windows 8**: Start -> Swipe Up -> All Apps -> Windows System -> right-click Command Prompt ->
"Run as Administrator"

**Windows 10**: Start Button -> type `cmd` -> right-click Command Prompt ->

**Debian/Ubuntu** `sudo /etc/rc.d/init.d/nscd restart`

**Linux with systemd**: `sudo systemctl restart network.service`

**Fedora Linux**: `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`

**Arch Linux/Manjaro with Network Manager**: `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service`

**Arch Linux/Manjaro with Wicd**: `sudo systemctl restart wicd.service`

**Others**: Consult [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29#Location_in_the_file_system).


## Goals of this unified hosts file

The goals of this repo are to:

1. automatically combine high-quality lists of hosts,

2. provide easy extensions,

3. de-dupe the resultant combined list,

4. and keep the resultant file reasonably sized.

A high-quality source is defined here as one that is actively curated.  A
hosts source should be frequently updated by its maintainers with both
additions and removals.  The larger the hosts file, the higher the level of
curation is expected.

For example, the (huge) hosts file from [hosts-file.net](http://hosts-file.net)
is **not** included here because it is very large (300,000+ entries)
and doesn't currently display a corresponding high level of curation activity.

It is expected that this unified hosts file will serve both desktop and mobile
devices under a variety of operating systems.
